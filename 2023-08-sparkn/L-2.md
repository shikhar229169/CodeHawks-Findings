## Vulnerability Details
Suppose that there was very tiny funding received of only 1, then the function will not be reverted and will still lead to distribution of winnings of 0 amount.
Suppose one winner got 50% winning reward, let's do the calculation
```solidity
uint256 amount = totalAmount * percentages[i] / BASIS_POINTS;
amount = 1 * 5000 / 10000 = 0 and lead to sending of 0 balance to winner, which should not be the case.
```

## Tools Used
Manual Testing

## Recommendations
- To have a check on the ```totalAmount``` that there should be some minimum amount then only we can distribute.
- Or we can modify the way we receive the fundings from sponsor, so instead of deploying the proxy contract after the contest is over, we should deploy it at the starting of contest and define a function to manage the fundings received to only allow user to fund for some minimum amount.
